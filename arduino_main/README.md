# Arduino
## The role of Arduino
We're using a Arduino Mega 2560 for this application. It's powered by the USB type B port which connects to our Raspberry Pi.
It controls 4 DC motors, a servo motor, and receives velocity data from the encoder, and distance information from three TOF distance sensors.
